# SuperTeam Creator

This App will let you create a Team of 6 characters, 3 heroes and 3 villains, and it will keep track in real time of the collective powerstats (intelligence, strength, etc.) of your team.

Characters of Neutral alignment are also acceptable, but without exceeding a maximum of 6 characters in total.

## Technical Specs

The State of the App is managed using React-Redux.

The Layout of the UI is built upon Bootswatch, a slightly customized version of Bootstrap, found here [https://bootswatch.com/] (The theme for this app is bootswatch Lux).

When you search for a character, the App looks it up in the following API: [https://superheroapi.com]
